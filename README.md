<h1>Waywatch</h1>
This project is a web application that allows users to view and interact with camera locations on a map. Users can register an account, log in and select their favorite live cameras. After upgrading to a premium account, users get access to premium cameras and can plan a travel route using various commute methods, along with seeing the cameras relevant for the chosen travel path.
